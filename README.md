# IAM + GRC Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio, where I'm documenting my hands-on journey into **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**.

As I transition into the cybersecurity field, my goal is to deepen my understanding of user access control, identity governance, and the policies that drive secure systems. This repo will include project write-ups, learning progress, tools Iâ€™ve explored, and reflections from labs and case studies.
